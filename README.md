## Running the Game üöÄ

This game is a single HTML file that includes all necessary CSS and JavaScript.

1.  **Download/Save:** Make sure you have the main HTML file for the game.
2.  **Image Assets (Crucial for Preschool Mode):**
    * Create a folder named `images` in the same directory as your HTML file.
    * Inside the `images` folder, create two more folders:
        * `animals`
        * `merged_animals`
    * **Place your base animal images** (e.g., `cat.png`, `dog.png`, `bear.png`, `lion.png`, `panda.png`) into the `images/animals/` folder.
    * **Create and place your merged animal images** (e.g., `bearcat.png`, `catdog.png`, ..., `bearcatdoglionpanda.png` ‚Äì a total of 26 for all direct base animal combinations, or more if you've implemented additive merging with unique intermediate visuals) into the `images/merged_animals/` folder. *The JavaScript code expects specific filenames based on the alphabetical concatenation of the base animal names.*
3.  **Open in Browser:** Simply open the HTML file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

## Development Note üõ†Ô∏è

This "Arithmetic & Counting Fun" game was conceptualized and its code was entirely generated through an iterative process with **Google's Gemini language model**. The development involved prompting for features, explaining requirements, debugging, and refining the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interactively with AI assistance.

## Future Ideas (Possible Enhancements) üí°

* Sound effects for correct/incorrect answers and sticker placement.
* More complex merging logic or visual effects for merges (if not already fully implemented).
* A "sticker book" or "collection page" to save and view all collected rewards.
* User accounts or progress saving (would require backend or more advanced LocalStorage usage).
* More varied shapes and visual elements for the counting game.
* Different types of rewards or mini-games unlocked by progress.
